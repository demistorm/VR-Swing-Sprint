## Version 1.0.0

Initial release of VR Swing Sprint!

- Sprint by swinging your arms in VR (like Blade and Sorcery)
- Intuitive, physical movement control without keyboard presses
- Supports Minecraft 1.21.5 on Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge
- Requires Vivecraft for VR gameplay
- Haptic feedback when sprint activates for satisfying feel
- Preserves mid-swing progress during direction changes

How it works:
- Swing both arms in a running motion to activate sprint
- Any arm swing while sprinting keeps you going
- Sprint gracefully stops after 1.5 seconds of not swinging
- Entirely client-side with no server interaction needed

Enjoy more immersive VR movement!
