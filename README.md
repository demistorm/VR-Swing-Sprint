# VR Swing Sprint
Mod that allows Vivecraft players to run by swinging their arms like Blade and Sorcery! 

---

## Modes
This mod has two modes: **Clientside-only** and **client and server**. 

#### Clientside-only
This mode automatically activates when the mod is not found on the server. In this mode, VR players can simply 
make a running motion to activate vanilla sprint (30% speed boost). This has no effect on non-VR players.

#### Client and Server (preferred)
This mode automatically activates when the mod *is* found on the server. This allows it to apply a **dynamic
sprint speed** depending on the arm's speed ranging from 15% to 60% at an all out sprint. The dynamic sprint
speed makes the effect helps to feel more natural and fun. 

This also disables some of the vanilla sprint-cancel conditions, giving the VR player full control of their
movement.

In both modes, this mod works by overriding Vivecraft's default autosprint (when the forward direction is pushed all the way, it 
activates sprint) and activating sprint instead by the player swinging their arms in a jogging/running motion.

I made this simple mod because I get vr motion sickness relatively easy and when the autosprint suddenly kicks in,
in adds a bit to that queasy feeling. I really enjoyed this feature in Blade and Sorcery and so here it is added to
Vivecraft :) It helps with the feeling a bit and adds just a little bit of immersion too. Hope you like it!
