# VR Swing Sprint
Mod that allows Vivecraft players to run by swinging their arms like Blade and Sorcery! 

---

Clientside only, VSS **does not need to be** installed on the server, only the client to work. 

This mod works by overriding Vivecraft's default autosprint (when the forward direction is pushed all the way, it 
activates sprint) and activating sprint instead by the player swinging their arms in a jogging/running motion.

I made this simple mod because I get vr motion sickness relatively easy and when the autosprint suddenly kicks in,
in adds a bit to that queasy feeling. I really enjoyed this feature in Blade and Sorcery and so here it is added to
Vivecraft :) It helps with the feeling a bit and adds just a little bit of immersion too. Hope you like it!
